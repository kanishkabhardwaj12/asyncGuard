# asyncGuard 🚀

**asyncGuard** is a backend-first platform focused on **authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and organization-based security workflows**, designed with scalability and clean architecture in mind.

This project is built to practice and demonstrate **real-world backend engineering patterns** using FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, JWT authentication, and PostgreSQL.
